## The `tidyr` package

## What is tidy data?

> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.<br>
Leo Tolstoy

- Resource: follow along tidyr vignette 
- available as 
`vignette("tidy-data", package="tidyr")`
- vignette is version of the [tidy data paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) with updated code

## Outline

- Different sources of messiness
- Key-Value pairs
- `tidyr`: `spread` and `gather`, `separate`


## Data is usually in a spreadsheet format, but...

there's different ways of encoding the same information:

Option #1
```{r echo = FALSE}
read.csv("../data/preg.csv")
```

Option #2
```{r echo = FALSE}
read.csv("../data/preg2.csv")
```

Neither #1 nor #2 are "clean" versions of the data: observed information is part of the data structure; some implicit information is assumed

## This format is not ideal for data analysis

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=2, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(french_fries) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x="1_buttery", y=buttery), fill = "cyan4") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_grassy", y = grassy), fill = "darkorange2") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_painty", y = painty), fill = "darkorchid1") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_potato", y = potato), fill = "chartreuse3") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_rancid", y = rancid), fill = "deeppink") +
  xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

## What we have and what we want
We want to change this **wide format**:

![Wide Format](images/tableoverview.png)

to this **long format**:

![Long Format](images/tablelong.png)

## Sources of Messiness

1. Column headers are values, not variable names.<br>
e.g. *treatmenta, treatmentb*
2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.<br>
e.g. *Fall 2015, Spring 2016* or *"1301 8th St SE, Orange City, Iowa 51041
(42.99755, -96.04149)", "2102 Durant, Harlan, Iowa 51537
(41.65672, -95.33780)"*
3. Multiple observational units are stored in the same table.
4. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

## Tidy data


1. Each variable forms one column.
2. Each observation forms one row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

![Long Format](images/tablelong.png)

## Clean version of the example

```{r echo = FALSE}
preg2 <- read.csv("../data/preg2.csv")
preg2 %>% gather(key = patient, value = score, 2:4) %>% 
  mutate(patient = gsub("\\.", " ", patient))
```

- `treatment` and `patient` uniquely describe a single row in the dataset.
- `treatment` and `patient` are **key variables**,
- `score` is a **measurement variable**
- this makes `treatment-patient` and `score` a **key-value pair**


## Key-value pairs (KVP)
 
**Key-Value pairs** (KVP) - also *attribute-value*, *field-value*, *name-value*:
abstract data representation that allows a lot of flexibility  

One way of telling whether a data set is tidy is to check that all keys for a value are aligned in one row:

| | |
|:------------- |:------------- | 
| | |
| <img src="images/kvp-unhappy.png" width=150> | <img src="images/kvp-happy.png" width=150>     | 
|Untidy data | Tidy data |

## Key-value pairs (KVP)

Keys/Identifiers:

- Identify a record (must be unique)
- Example: Indices on an random variable
- Fixed by design of experiment (known in advance)
- May be single or composite (may have one or more variables)

Values/Measures:

- Collected during the experiment (not known in advance)
- Usually numeric quantities

## Tidying data - Plan of attack

Very few functions are needed for tidying data:

> 1. Messy (1): `tidyr` functions `gather` and `spread`.  
`gather (data, key, value, ...)`: take multiple columns and collapse into key-value pairs <br>
`spread (data, key, value, fill = NA)`: spread a key-value pair across multiple columns.
> 2. Messy (2): `tidyr` function `separate (data, col, into, sep = " ")`:
separate one column into multiple columns
> 3. Messy (3): `dplyr` - some combination of the functions discussed previously
> 4. Messy (4): `dplyr` functionality `join` (and friends) to combine multiple data sets 


## Gather

- When gathering, you need to specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures).

```{r}
french_fries_long <- french_fries %>% gather(key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty)
french_fries_long
```

## Let's Reconstruct our Plot

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(french_fries_long) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=variable, y=rating, fill = variable))
```

## Long to Wide

In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (Perhaps displaying in a table).

```{r}
head(french_fries_long)
```

## Spread

We use the **spread** function from `tidyr` to do this:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
french_fries_wide <- french_fries_long %>% spread(key = variable, value = rating)

head(french_fries_wide)
```

## Spread

```{r}
french_fries_long %>% spread(key = rep, value = rating)
```

##

```{r, warning = FALSE}
french_fries_long %>% spread(key = rep, value = rating) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`, y = `2`)) + geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~variable) + geom_abline(colour = "grey50")
```

## separate

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = c(NA, "a.b", "a.d", "b.c"))
df
df %>% separate(x, into = c("A", "B"))
```


## Your Turn (5 min)

The Iowa Data Portal is a wealth of information on and about the State of Iowa. 

The website 
[Campaign Expenditures](https://data.iowa.gov/Government/Campaign-Expenditures/3adi-mht4/data) provides data on campaign expenditures. The code below reads the data into an R session.

```
url <- "https://data.iowa.gov/api/views/3adi-mht4/rows.csv"
campaign <- readr::read_csv(url)
```

Assess the 'messiness' of the data. List issues that prevent us from working with the data directly. Which of these issues are of type (1) or (2) of messiness?

## Problems with the data

- `Date` is text, in the format of Month/Day/Year (Messy 2)
- city coordinates are a combination of City name, state, zip code and geographic latitude and longitude. (Messy 2)
- expenditure amount is a textual expression, not a number (Messy different)

no Messy 1? - problems of type Messy 1 are typically hard to detect and often up to interpretation/dependent on the analysis to be done.


## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

1. Read in the billboard top 100 music data:

```{r}
billboard <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/billboard.csv")
```
    
2. Use `tidyr` to convert this data into a long format.

3. Use ``ggplot2`` to create something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
long_billboard <- gather(billboard, key = week, value = rank, X1:X76)
long_billboard$week <- as.numeric(gsub("X", "", long_billboard$week))


ggplot(long_billboard) + geom_line(aes(week, rank, colour = artist, group = track))+
  xlim(c(0, 30))

```

<!--
## Your Turn (10 min)

- Check the help for the function `parse_number` in the `readr` package and use it on the campaign expenditure data.
- Use `separate` to split the date variable into year, month and day.
- Use `separate` again to extract geographic latitude and longitude (Hint - you might need several steps of `separate`)
- Using `dplyr` functionality answer the following questions:

  1. What is the total amount of campaign expenditure?
  2. What is the single largest cost in the campaign expenditures?
  3. What time frame does the campaign expenditure cover?
  4. Plot geographic longitude and latitude. Do campaign expenditures stay in the State of IA? Investigate oddities.

## Another Your-Turn (10 mins) {data-background=#527a7a}

During the 1870 census data on people's occupation was collected. The data [occupation-1870](../data/occupation-1870.csv) contains state-level aggregates of occupation by gender.

- Use `tidyr` to get the data into a long format. 
- Separate the `occupation.gender` type variable into two variables.
- Spread the data such that you can draw scatterplots of values for men against women facetted by occupation.

<!--
## Your Turn - Sample Solution

```{r}
occupation <- read.csv("../data/occupation-1870.csv")

# combine all of the variables (except for State) 
# into a single variable
occupation <- occupation %>% 
  gather(key="Occ.gender", value="Number", 2:11)
occupation
```

## Your Turn - Sample Solution (cont'd)

```{r}
# split Occ.gender into two variables
occupation <- occupation %>% 
  separate(Occ.gender, into = c("Occupation", "Gender"))
occupation
```

## Your Turn - Sample Solution (cont'd)

```{r}
# now spread the data again
occ2 <- occupation %>% spread(Gender, Number)
occ2
```

## Your Turn - Sample Solution (cont'd)

```{r}
occ2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Male, y = Female)) + geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Occupation)
```

## Dates and Times

Dates are deceptively hard to work with in R.

**Example**: 02/05/2012. Is it February 5th, or May 2nd?

Other things are difficult too:

- Time zones
- POSIXct format in base R is challenging

The **lubridate** package helps tackle some of these issues.

## Basic Lubridate Use

```{r, results='hold', message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

now()
today()
now() + hours(4)
today() - days(2)
```

## Parsing Dates

```{r, results='hold'}
ymd("2013-05-14")
mdy("05/14/2013")
dmy("14052013")
ymd_hms("2013:05:14 14:50:30", tz = "America/Chicago")
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}


The flights dataset contains information on over 300,000 flights that departed from New York City in the year 2013.

```{r}
flights <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/flights.csv")
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

1. Using the `flights` data, create a new column Date using lubridate. You will need to paste together the columns year, month, and day in order to do this. See the `paste` function.
2. Use `dplyr` to calculate the average departure delay for each date.
3. Plot the date versus the average departure delay

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, purl = FALSE}
flights$date <- ymd(paste(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day, sep = "-"))
delay.dat <- flights %>% 
    group_by(date) %>% 
    summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))


ggplot(delay.dat) + geom_line(aes(date, dep_delay))

```


```{r purl, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
#copy paste this and run in console
#knitr::purl("03-r-format/knitr/3-tidyr.Rmd", output="03-r-format/code/3-tidyr.R", documentation = 0)
```
